# Hi! I'm alice. âœ¨
Like the character, Alice from Alice in Wonderland, I end up in a rabbithole a lot. 
Today, it might be new science facts I never knew, tomorrow it could be figuring out new ways to implement
something I had done yesterday!

### ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer and I'm always learning.

I completed my bootcamp program on Dec 20, 2022 and I can't wait to join, discover and learn all the new shiny things in the world of software development!
